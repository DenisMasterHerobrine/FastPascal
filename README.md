<div align="center"> <h1>  FastPascal</h1> </div>
<div align="center"> FastPascal is a PascalABC.NET unit method library which adds methods available in other programming languages such as Java/Python/C++ and some utilities to do Pascal stuff. Originally started as a school project.</div>

# Information
There are several modules such as:
- Integer: allows to do specific stuff with 2 or more integers such as swapping or moving or finding minimum or maximum.
- Arrays: allows to do specific stuff with arrays and its elements such as sorting or moving elements of the array.
- Math: allows to do specific calculations while Pascal not adds such procedures or functions.
- GraphAPI: This API allows to generate graphics of some simple mathematical functions and drawing beautiful things for whatever reason. 
- SolverAPI: Solves different mathematical problems with very high accuracy.

# Examples? Documentation?
 - "master" branch contains Examples folder and full .pcu and .pas documented library files.
