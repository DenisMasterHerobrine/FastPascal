<div align="center"> <h1> FastPascal & FastGraph</h1> </div>
<div align="center"> FastPascal is a PascalABC.NET unit method library which adds methods available in other programming languages such as Java/Python/C++ and some utilities to do Pascal stuff. Originally started as a school project.</div>

# Information
There are several modules in FastPascal such as:
- Arrays: allows to do specific stuff with arrays and its elements such as sorting or moving elements of the array.
- Math: allows to do specific calculations while Pascal not adds such procedures or functions.
- Array Sorters: allows to sort elements in the array with an ability to sort alphabetically or other methods.
- (WIP) SolverAPI: Solves different mathematical problems with very high accuracy.
- Unused: Specific program algorithms that may or may not work as intended and written only for specific school tasks. Probably will be removed on release.

There are also some modules in FastGraph such as:
- GraphAPI: This API allows to generate graphics of some simple mathematical functions and drawing beautiful things for whatever reason. 

# Examples? Documentation?
 - "master" branch contains Examples folder and full .pcu and .pas documented library files.
 - FastPascal Wiki is WIP as of now. Will be released when it is released.
